# Begin Development Recommendations

## Objective
Recommend a starting document for the forge agent to review and suggest an AI model for development resumption.

## Implementation Plan
1. **[Review recommended starting document]**
  - Dependencies: None
  - Notes: Direct to ROADMAP.md for phased overview
  - Files: ROADMAP.md
  - Status: Not Started
2. **[Select and integrate AI model]**
  - Dependencies: Task 1
  - Notes: Recommend Gemini for core development tasks
  - Files: agent_comm/src/geminiAgent.ts
  - Status: Not Started
3. **[Proceed with Phase 0 completion]**
  - Dependencies: Task 2
  - Notes: Replace mocks, add tests
  - Files: agent_comm/src/*.ts
  - Status: Not Started

## Verification Criteria
- Agent reviews ROADMAP.md and aligns with phases
- Selected model integrates without issues
- Development resumes without outage-related regressions

## Potential Risks and Mitigations
1. **[Model incompatibility]**
  Mitigation: Test integration early
2. **[Document misalignment]**
  Mitigation: Cross-reference with VISION.md

## Alternative Approaches
1. Start with VISION.md: For high-level inspiration before details
2. Use Claude model: If preferred for code tasks
