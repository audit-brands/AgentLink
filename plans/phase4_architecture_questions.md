   - What level of workflow nesting should we support?
   - How should we handle workflow versioning?

## 2. Distributed Consensus

1. What consensus mechanism should we implement for leader election?

   - Should we consider an existing solution like etcd or implement our own?
   - What failure detection mechanisms should we employ?

2. How should we handle split-brain scenarios?
   - What quorum requirements should we enforce?
   - How aggressive should failure detection be?
   - What recovery procedures should be in place?

## 3. State Management

1. What consistency model should we adopt for global state?
   - Do we need strong consistency or is eventual consistency sufficient?
   - How should we handle conflicting state updates?
   - What state replication strategy should we use?

2. How should we partition state across nodes?
