# Phase 4 Requirements Analysis

## Current Requirements

### Infrastructure Requirements
- Minimum 3 nodes for High Availability (HA)
- 4 CPU cores per node
- 16GB RAM per node
- SSD storage
- 1Gbps network connectivity

## Assumptions Analysis

### 1. High Availability (3 nodes minimum)

#### Assumption
- System must maintain operation if one node fails
- Quorum-based decision making requires odd number of nodes
- Need to handle planned maintenance without service interruption

#### Reality Check
- Do we actually need full HA for all components?
- Could we start with 2 nodes and a lightweight arbiter?
- What is our actual uptime requirement (99.9% vs 99.99%)?

### 2. CPU Requirements (4 cores)

#### Assumption
- Heavy computational load for orchestration
- Multiple concurrent workflows
- Background tasks for monitoring and maintenance

#### Reality Check
- What is our expected workflow complexity?
- How CPU-intensive are our agent operations?
- Could we start with 2 cores and scale based on metrics?

### 3. Memory Requirements (16GB)

#### Assumption
- Large workflow state storage
- In-memory caching for performance
- Buffer space for message queues
- JVM/Node.js runtime overhead

#### Reality Check
- What is our actual working set size?
- Do we need this much cache?
- Could we use more efficient state storage?

### 4. Storage (SSD)

#### Assumption
- High I/O requirements for state persistence
- Quick recovery from node failures
- Fast log processing

#### Reality Check
- What is our actual write volume?
- Could we tier storage (hot/cold data)?
- Is durability more important than speed?

### 5. Network (1Gbps)

#### Assumption
- High volume of inter-node communication
- Large state synchronization needs
- Real-time monitoring data transfer

#### Reality Check
- What is our expected network traffic?
- Could we optimize protocol efficiency?
- Do we need this bandwidth everywhere?

## Revised Recommendations

### Minimum Viable Infrastructure (MVI)

#### Development/Testing Environment
- 2 nodes + 1 lightweight arbiter
- 2 CPU cores per node
- 8GB RAM per node
- Standard SSD storage
- 100Mbps network

#### Production Environment (Initial)
- 3 nodes for HA
- 4 CPU cores per node
- 16GB RAM per node
- SSD storage
- 1Gbps network

#### Scale-Out Triggers
1. CPU utilization consistently > 70%
2. Memory usage consistently > 80%
3. Storage I/O latency > 10ms
4. Network utilization > 70%

## Questions to Consider

1. **Availability Requirements**
   - What is our target uptime SLA?
   - What is the cost of downtime?
   - Do different components need different availability levels?

2. **Performance Requirements**
   - What is our expected peak load?
   - What is our acceptable latency?
   - How many concurrent workflows do we need to support?

3. **Data Requirements**
   - How much state data do we need to maintain?
   - What is our data retention policy?
   - What are our backup requirements?

4. **Cost Considerations**
   - What is our infrastructure budget?
   - Can we use spot instances for non-critical nodes?
   - Should we consider managed services vs self-hosted?

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Development Setup
- Start with minimum configuration
- Implement monitoring and metrics
- Establish baseline performance

### Phase 2: Production Pilot
- Deploy full HA configuration
- Validate performance assumptions
- Test failure scenarios

### Phase 3: Scale Testing
- Load testing with production-like data
- Validate scaling triggers
- Optimize resource usage

### Phase 4: Production Deployment
- Roll out with full requirements
- Monitor and adjust based on actual usage
- Document operational patterns

## Success Metrics

1. **Availability**
   - Measure actual uptime
   - Track recovery times
   - Monitor failure rates

2. **Performance**
   - Workflow completion times
   - Resource utilization
   - Network latency

3. **Scalability**
   - Time to scale out/in
   - Resource efficiency
   - Cost per workflow

## Risk Assessment

1. **Over-Provisioning**
   - Cost: High initial infrastructure cost
   - Mitigation: Start with MVI and scale based on metrics

2. **Under-Provisioning**
   - Cost: Performance issues, potential downtime
   - Mitigation: Conservative scaling triggers, monitoring

3. **Complexity**
   - Cost: Operational overhead, maintenance complexity
   - Mitigation: Automation, clear documentation, monitoring

## Next Steps

1. Validate assumptions with:
   - Load testing
   - Proof of concept deployment
   - Cost analysis

2. Create detailed monitoring plan:
   - Resource utilization
   - Performance metrics
   - Cost tracking

3. Develop scaling playbooks:
   - When to scale
   - How to scale
   - Rollback procedures
