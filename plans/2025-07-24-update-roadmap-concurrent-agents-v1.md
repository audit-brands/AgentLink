# Update Roadmap for Concurrent Agents

## Objective
Assess if a solid roadmap is in place, update it to evaluate concurrent AI agent development on the same branch, and incorporate orchestration between multiple sub-agents where appropriate.

## Implementation Plan
1. **[Review and assess current roadmap solidity]**
  - Dependencies: None
  - Notes: Confirm phased structure and identify gaps
  - Files: ROADMAP.md
  - Status: Not Started
2. **[Update for concurrent agent development]**
  - Dependencies: Task 1
  - Notes: Add evaluation of same-branch feasibility with mitigations
  - Files: Updated roadmap sections
  - Status: Not Started
3. **[Incorporate sub-agent orchestration]**
  - Dependencies: Task 2
  - Notes: Integrate into phases like P2/P3 for streaming and coordination
  - Files: ROADMAP.md phases
  - Status: Not Started
4. **[Document and verify updates]**
  - Dependencies: Task 3
  - Notes: Ensure alignment with A2A
  - Files: New plan file
  - Status: Not Started

## Verification Criteria
- Roadmap covers concurrency feasibility and orchestration
- Updates maintain phased structure
- No conflicts with existing A2A adoption

## Potential Risks and Mitigations
1. **[Branch conflicts in concurrency]**
  Mitigation: Implement locking or branching strategies
2. **[Orchestration overhead]**
  Mitigation: Start with lightweight mechanisms

## Alternative Approaches
1. Feature branches: Avoid same-branch issues at cost of merge overhead
2. Centralized orchestrator: For sub-agents instead of peer-to-peer
