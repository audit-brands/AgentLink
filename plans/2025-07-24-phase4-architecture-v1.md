# Phase 4 Architecture: Distributed Orchestration Design

## Objective
Define the architectural approach for implementing distributed orchestration capabilities in AgentLink while maintaining security, reliability, and performance.

## Core Architecture Decisions

### 1. Orchestration Patterns

#### Decision: Hybrid Orchestration-Choreography Pattern
- Primary orchestrator node for global coordination
- Local orchestrators for node-level decisions
- Event-driven choreography for agent interactions

Rationale:
- Balances central control with local autonomy
- Reduces cross-node communication overhead
- Supports graceful degradation

#### Workflow Structure
- Hierarchical workflow definitions
  - Global workflows (cross-node)
  - Local workflows (node-specific)
  - Agent workflows (agent-specific)
- Version control through semantic versioning
- Immutable workflow definitions

### 2. Distributed Consensus

#### Decision: Raft-based Consensus with etcd
- Use etcd for leader election and consensus
- Implement watch mechanisms for state changes
- Configure for moderate consistency requirements

Rationale:
- Battle-tested implementation
- Good balance of consistency and performance
- Strong community support
- Built-in security features

#### Split-Brain Prevention
- Quorum requirement: (N/2 + 1) nodes
- Fencing mechanisms for isolated nodes
- Automatic step-down of minority partitions

### 3. State Management

#### Decision: Multi-Level State Architecture
- Global State (Strong Consistency)
  - Workflow definitions
  - Security policies
  - Agent registry
- Regional State (Eventual Consistency)
  - Workflow status
  - Performance metrics
  - Resource allocation
- Local State (Node-Level)
  - Agent status
  - Task queues
  - Performance counters

#### State Synchronization
- CRDTs for conflict resolution
- Event sourcing for state reconstruction
- Periodic state snapshots
- Optimistic replication with conflict detection

### 4. Scaling Strategy

#### Decision: Metric-Based Auto-Scaling
Scaling Triggers:
- CPU utilization > 70%
- Memory usage > 80%
- Task queue latency > 100ms
- Active workflows per node > 1000

Cross-Environment Orchestration:
- Environment isolation through namespaces
- Cross-environment gateways
- Policy-based routing
- Traffic prioritization

### 5. Monitoring and Observability

#### Decision: Three-Tier Monitoring Stack
1. Infrastructure Metrics
   - Node health
   - Network latency
   - Resource utilization
   - Queue depths

2. Application Metrics
   - Workflow throughput
   - Error rates
   - Task completion times
   - Agent performance

3. Business Metrics
   - Success rates
   - SLA compliance
   - Cost efficiency
   - Resource optimization

#### Distributed Tracing
- OpenTelemetry implementation
- Sampling rate: 10% base, 100% for errors
- Trace correlation across nodes
- Automatic bottleneck detection

### 6. Fault Tolerance

#### Decision: Multi-Level Resilience
Retry Strategy:
- Exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s
- Maximum 5 retries per task
- Circuit breaker thresholds:
  - 50% error rate over 1 minute
  - 5 second timeout
  - 30 second reset timer

Recovery Mechanisms:
- Workflow checkpointing
- State replication
- Task queue persistence
- Dead letter queues

### 7. Security

#### Decision: Zero Trust Architecture
Node Security:
- mTLS for node communication
- Rotating certificates (24h lifetime)
- Network policy enforcement
- Regular security audits

Data Security:
- Encryption at rest
- TLS 1.3 in transit
- Key rotation
- Audit logging
