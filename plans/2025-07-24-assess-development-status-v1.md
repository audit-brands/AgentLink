# Assess Development Status

## Objective
Review recent commits and roadmap to determine where development left off after the outage, provide an assessment, and outline a plan to proceed, including a question on preferred AI model for development.

## Implementation Plan
1. **Verify repository status and recover from outage**
  - Dependencies: None
  - Notes: Check for uncommitted changes or conflicts; may require user input if issues found
  - Files: .git/logs/refs/heads/main, agent_comm/package.json
  - Status: Not Started
2. **Build and test current codebase**
  - Dependencies: Task 1
  - Notes: Ensure compilation succeeds and run manual checks; add basic tests if absent
  - Files: agent_comm/src/*.ts, tsconfig.json
  - Status: Not Started
3. **Replace mocked CLI invocations with actual ones**
  - Dependencies: Task 2
  - Notes: Update agent logic to use real CLI calls with error handling
  - Files: agent_comm/src/claudeAgent.ts, agent_comm/src/geminiAgent.ts
  - Status: Not Started
4. **Implement dynamic agent discovery**
  - Dependencies: Task 3
  - Notes: Replace hardcodes with configurable options
  - Files: agent_comm/src/registry.ts
  - Status: Not Started
5. **Add security features and full error handling**
  - Dependencies: Task 4
  - Notes: Introduce basic authentication and retries
  - Files: agent_comm/src/*.ts
  - Status: Not Started

## Verification Criteria
- Successful build with no compilation errors
- Agents can communicate and process tasks without mocks
- Dynamic discovery works with configurable endpoints
- Error handling catches and logs failures appropriately
- Security features prevent unauthorized access

## Potential Risks and Mitigations
1. **CLI integration failures**
  Mitigation: Test incrementally with fallback to mocks
2. **Configuration changes breaking existing setup**
  Mitigation: Use version control and test in isolation

## Alternative Approaches
1. Strict phasing: Complete Phase 0 fully before advancing, ensuring stability
2. Interleaved features: Incorporate Phase 1 elements early for faster progress
