# AgentLink Architecture Analysis: Updated Phase 4 Focus

## Current Implementation Focus

The project is entering Phase 4 with a focused approach on local system optimization:

### Local Orchestration Priority
- Perfect single-system agent coordination
- Optimize resource usage within host constraints
- Enhance workflow management efficiency
- Implement comprehensive monitoring

### Resource Constraints
- Host System: 20GB total memory
- Target Usage: < 8GB for AgentLink
- Efficient CPU sharing
- Optimized storage usage

### Key Components for Phase 4.1
1. Resource Management
   - Memory optimization
   - CPU scheduling
   - Storage efficiency
   - Performance monitoring

2. Workflow Optimization
   - Enhanced task scheduling
   - Improved agent lifecycle
   - Efficient state management
   - Error handling

3. Monitoring Infrastructure
   - Resource usage tracking
   - Performance metrics
   - System health checks
   - Alert mechanisms

Future phases will address network distribution after achieving robust local orchestration.# AgentLink Architecture Analysis: A Summary

This document provides a structured overview of the AgentLink project's architecture, core components, communication flow, identified issues, and recommendations, based on an analysis of its codebase.

## 1. Architecture Overview

AgentLink is an early-stage Proof-of-Concept (PoC) for the Inter-Agent Collaboration Protocol (IACP), incorporating elements of the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol. It's built as a Node.js/TypeScript application designed to facilitate communication between AI agents, specifically wrappers for Gemini and Claude CLIs.

### Project Structure:
*   **Root Directory:** Contains high-level documentation such as `VISION.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, and `DECISIONS.md`, outlining project goals, phased A2A adoption, and key decisions (e.g., pivot from Python to Node.js for stability, use of TypeScript for type safety).
*   **`agent_comm/` Subdirectory:** The core Node.js project, containing:
    *   `src/`: TypeScript source files for agent wrappers (`claudeAgent.ts`, `geminiAgent.ts`), an agent discovery registry (`registry.ts`), and a task runner (`runTask.ts`).
    *   `dist/`: Compiled JavaScript output.
    *   `node_modules/`: Project dependencies (e.g., Express.js, Axios, TypeScript).
    *   Configuration files: `package.json` (defines build and start scripts) and `tsconfig.json` (standard ES2020/ESNext setup with strict type checking).

## 2. Core Components and Communication Flow

### Agent Servers:
*   Each agent (Claude on port 5000, Gemini on 5001) runs an Express.js HTTP server.
*   They expose a JSON-RPC 2.0 endpoint for methods like "RequestRefactor," which processes tasks (e.g., code refactoring) using mocked CLI invocations.
*   They also serve A2A-style Agent Cards via `/.well-known/agent.json` for discovery.

### Registry (`registry.ts`):
*   Discovers agents by fetching their Agent Cards from hardcoded localhost endpoints.
*   Registers agent capabilities.
*   Logs agent information to the console.

### Task Runner (`runTask.ts`):
*   Acts as a client to the agent servers.
*   Sends JSON-RPC 2.0 requests (e.g., "RequestRefactor") to agents.
*   Handles responses and logs the outcome.

### Communication Flow:
1.  **Discovery:** The `registry.ts` script discovers agents by querying their `/.well-known/agent.json` endpoints.
2.  **Task Initiation:** The `runTask.ts` script sends a JSON-RPC 2.0 request to a specific agent's server.
3.  **Task Execution:** The agent server receives the request, processes the task (e.g., by invoking a mocked CLI command), and returns a JSON-RPC 2.0 response.

## 3. Identified Issues and Areas for Improvement

### Hardcoded Values:
*   Agent URLs and ports are hardcoded in `registry.ts` and `runTask.ts`. This limits flexibility and scalability.
*   **Recommendation:** Externalize configuration (e.g., using environment variables or a dedicated configuration file).

### Mocked CLI Invocations:
*   The current implementation uses mocked CLI invocations (`execSync('echo ...')`). This is suitable for a PoC but needs to be replaced with actual CLI interactions for real-world use.
*   **Recommendation:** Implement robust `child_process` handling for actual CLI execution, including error handling and output streaming.

### Error Handling:
*   Error handling appears basic, primarily relying on `try-catch` blocks without detailed logging or recovery mechanisms.
*   **Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive error handling, including structured logging, retry mechanisms, and graceful degradation.

### Scalability and Discovery:
*   The current discovery mechanism is limited to hardcoded localhost endpoints.
*   **Recommendation:** Explore more dynamic agent discovery mechanisms (e.g., mDNS, a centralized discovery service, or a more robust A2A implementation).

### Security:
*   No explicit security measures (e.g., authentication, authorization, input validation) are mentioned or apparent in the analysis.
*   **Recommendation:** Implement security best practices, especially if agents will be exposed over a network.

### Testing:
*   The analysis does not mention the presence of unit or integration tests.
*   **Recommendation:** Implement a testing suite (e.g., using Vitest or Jest) to ensure the reliability and correctness of agent interactions and core logic.

### Protocol Adherence:
*   While leveraging A2A elements, full adherence to the IACP or A2A protocol specifications is not explicitly detailed.
*   **Recommendation:** Clearly define the level of protocol adherence and implement features accordingly.

## 4. Conclusion

AgentLink serves as a foundational PoC for inter-agent communication. While demonstrating the core concept, it requires significant development in areas such as configuration, robust CLI integration, error handling, scalability, and security to evolve into a production-ready system. The current architecture provides a clear starting point for further development.
